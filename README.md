# ðŸ“Š 1. Liberal Arts College Data Analysis  
*HTML Scraping + Matplotlib Visualization*  

## Overview  
Analyzed academic/residential patterns across 3 liberal arts colleges by:  
- Scraping public data using `BeautifulSoup`  
- Visualizing major overlaps with `matplotlib.venn3` (40% overlap detected)  
- Identifying dormitory correlations via heatmaps  

## Tech Stack  
```python
Python 3 | BeautifulSoup4 | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn
```


# Interactive Cartoon Scene Generator  
*Procedural Image Generation with Python and PIL/Pillow*  


## Features  
- **Drag-and-drop character placement** (supports 4 characters per scene)  
- **Custom text rendering** with system fonts (Georgia, Arial, etc.)  
- **Procedural effects**:  
  - Randomized starry backgrounds (`add_stars()`)  
  - Dynamic terrain coloring (`randint` RGB manipulation)  
  - Vintage photo filter (10% red boost, 20% blue reduction)  
- **Input validation** for missing image files  

## Tech Stack  
```python
Python 3 | Pillow (PIL) | Random | OS (File I/O)
