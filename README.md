1. # Liberal Arts College Data Analysis & Cartoon Scene Generator# 

Two Python projects demonstrating **web scraping, data visualization, and procedural image generation**.

---

## ðŸ“Š 1. Liberal Arts College Data Analysis  
*HTML Scraping + Matplotlib Visualization*  

### Overview  
Analyzed academic/residential patterns across 3 liberal arts colleges by:  
- Scraping public data using `BeautifulSoup`  
- Visualizing major overlaps with `matplotlib.venn3` (40% overlap detected)  
- Identifying dormitory correlations via heatmaps  

### Tech Stack  
```python
Python 3 | BeautifulSoup4 | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn






2. # ðŸŽ¨ Interactive Cartoon Scene Generator# 
*Procedural Image Generation with Python and PIL/Pillow*  

![Sample Scene](demo.png)  
*Example output with custom characters and vintage filter*

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Drag-and-drop character placement** (supports 4 characters per scene)  
- **Custom text rendering** with system fonts (Georgia, Arial, etc.)  
- **Procedural effects**:  
  - Randomized starry backgrounds (`add_stars()`)  
  - Dynamic terrain coloring (`randint` RGB manipulation)  
  - Vintage photo filter (10% red boost, 20% blue reduction)  
- **Input validation** for missing image files  

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack  
```python
Python 3 | Pillow (PIL) | Random | OS (File I/O)
